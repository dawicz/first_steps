#This will learn me how to use strings and how to input a value into text

adj = input("Adjective:")
verb1 = input("Verb: ")
verb2 = input("Verb: ")
place = input("Place: ")
#Input will ask user for value

text = f"My life is so {adj}. Whole day I can only to {verb1}. And at the end of every day I need \
to {verb2}. I wish I were in {place}."

#using f"..." let me making concatenations, that meas inserting desired value in the round brackets {}.

print(text)
